# Hello!

I'm Vilberg, a Developer based in Sweden. After over 5 years of experience in Web Development, I've recently started my journey to learn more about Rust and systems programming! I will be sharing what I learn on the way on this website. My aim is to make my posts as short and to-the-point as I can so that we can all maximise our time learning!

If you're curious to learn more, take a look at my [first post](/posts/how-im-learning-rust) about why and how I intend to learn Rust!
